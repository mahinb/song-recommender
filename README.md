# song-recommender

This is a script that uses Spotify's API and https://reccobeats.com to give song recommendations based on audio features such as acousticness, loudness, tempo, etc. You can either get recommendations by inputting the name of a song or by inputting a public playlist id. To use this script you will need to have access to Spotify app credentials for API authorization to obtain an access token for making API calls (more info at https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api).
